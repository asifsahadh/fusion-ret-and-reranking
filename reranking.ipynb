    "To be quite honest, I do not expect the responses to be far superior than the vanilla approach due to the main reason being that these LLMs still require context and in-depth domain knowledge to truly understand how to rank the final set of chunks or documents appropriately. However, depending on how good the LLM is (in terms of size and data that it was trained on), the results will vary."

    "The approach is pretty straight forward here. The main area where the changes happen is at the last stage where we need prompt an LLM once more to retrieve the top-k indices from the final retrieved set of chunks.<br><br>\n",
    "Initially, the document data is extracted, specifically text and tabular data. Next, these data are stored in a way where the sequence is maintained, that way there will be more context for a certain text that may have a table before or after it. This set is chunked and converted BERT based vector embeddings. BERT was chosen because from what I know, they can represent these chunks in a very context aware fashion, thanks to the encoder representation from transformers. Now the query is also converted to BERT based embeddings and using cosine similarity, top-k chunks are retrieved.<br><br>\n",
    "Now these chunks, along with the query and chunk ID is passed into an LLM for further ranking. The LLM returns a list of most relevant chunks (5 was chosen). These indices are retrieved from the original set of chunks and this set of text, which acts as context, along with the query, is passed into a new LLM for information retrieval."
