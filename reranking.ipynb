However, depending on how good the LLM is (in terms of size and amount of data that it was trained on), the results will vary."

    "The approach is pretty straight forward here and the main area where the changes take place compared to vanilla RAG is at the last stage where an LLM is prompted to retrieve the top-L indexes from the final retrieved set of chunks. Teh workflow is as follows:<br>\n",
    "1. The document data is extracted, specifically text and tabular data. \n",
    "2. These data are stored in a way where the sequence is maintained, that way there will be more context for a certain text that may have a table before or after it. \n",
    "3. This set is chunked and converted to BERT based vector embeddings. BERT was chosen because from what I know, they can represent these chunks in a very context aware fashion, thanks to the utilization os the encoder of a transformers. \n",
    "4. Now the query is also converted to BERT based embeddings and using cosine similarity, the top-K chunks are retrieved.\n",
    "5. Now these chunks, along with the query and chunk IDs is passed into an LLM for further ranking. \n",
    "6. The LLM returns a list of IDs of the top-L relevant chunks (L < K). \n",

    "_**Note**: Considering images is important in order to create a robust RAG system. However, due to technical/financial constraints, images are omitted for this implementation. However, in the absence of such constraints, what I would have done is have the LLM read the image and prompt it to generate a description. This description will be added into the resulting array while also maintaining the sequence. One obvious question in that case will be whether or not the LLM knows about the content in the image, provided that it is very domain specific and unfamiliar to the LLM. One way I thought of on mitigating this issue is by providing some set of surrounding context of the image to the LLM along with the image itself for it to draw better conclusions. These contexts can be the nearest 2 or 3 elements (text, table or another image) surrounding the image in hand. Let this value be J. So, if J is 3, we feed 3 elements before the image and 3 elements after the image as context for the LLM to generate proper a description of the image in hand. This might not be the most robust solution, but there can be scenarios where this will work._"
