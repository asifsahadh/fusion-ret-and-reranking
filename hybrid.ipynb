    "The addition here as compared to the Fusion Retrieval architecture is the addition of an LLM based reranking approach right before asking an LLM to generate the response. In this case, there will be 3 sets of chunks throughout the workflow. First will be the set that is returned from the initial BERT embeddings and BM25 representations. This will be denoted as top-K. The next set of chunks will be based on the fusion scores from the semantic based retried chunks and keyword based retrieved chunks. This will be denoted as top-L. And finally, this set of L chunks will be passed into the first LLM for reranking. The chunks returned here will be the top-M chunks which will be the final set of context for our second and final LLM for query answering.<br>\n",

    "3. This set is chunked and converted to BERT based vector embeddings and also to BM25 based representations.\n",
    "4. Now the query is also converted to BERT based embeddings and BM25 based representations and the top-K chunks are retrieved for both. A union is taken between the retrieved chunks to avoid overlaps.\n",
    "5. Next, this final set of chunks are again made into 2 copies, one of BERT based embeddings and the other of BM25 based inverted indexes. The query is passed into both structures and the scores are retrieved for each chunk. This gives us a set of chunk IDs, BERT scores, BM25 scores and the final fusion score. \n",
    "6. Based on this fusion score, the top-L chunks are retrieved (L < K). \n",
    "7. These top-L chunks are passed into the first LLM for reranking, which returns the top-M chunks based on its knowledge and understanding (M < L).\n",

To operate the transverse feed, forward and backward, move the lever to the right (toward the tailstock), to operate the longitudinal feed, left and right, move the lever to the left (toward the spindle). (K) Handwheel for longitudinal displacement of the tool holder slide:  The handwheel allows the quick longitudinal displacement, to the right and left, of the tool holder slide. To move the slide to the left (towards the spindle), turn the handwheel clockwise and vice versa to move the slide to the right (towards the tailstock), rotate the handwheel anticlockwise. (L) Handwheel for longitudinal movement of the carriage:  The handwheel allows the quick longitudinal displacement, to the right and left, of the tool holder carriage. To move the carriage to the right (towards the tailstock), turn the handwheel clockwise and vice versa to move the carriage to the left (towards the spindle), rotate the handwheel anticlockwise. (M) Handwheel for transversal displacement of the tool holder slide:  The handwheel allows the transversal displacement, forward and backward, of the tool holder slide. To move the slide forward (towards the workpiece), turn the handwheel clockwise and vice versa to move the slide backward (towards the operator), rotate the handwheel anticlockwise. (N) Handwheel for longitudinal displacement of the tool holder slide:  The handwheel allows the quick longitudinal displacement, to the right and left, of the tool holder slide. To move the slide to the left (towards the spindle), turn the handwheel clockwise and vice versa to move the slide to the right (towards the tailstock), rotate the handwheel anticlockwise.
