    ">The main approach taken here is where the chunks are made into two copies, one is semantic based (using BERT), and the other is keyword based (BM25). After the top-k chunks are retrieved from both, a union is taken. Next, this final set of chunks are again made into 2 copies of BERT based embeddings and BM25 based inverted indexes. The query is passed into both structures and the scores are retrieved for each chunk. This gives us a table of chunk IDs, BERT scores, BM25 scores and the final fusion score. This is the main idea and the process goes as follows:<br><br>\n",
    ">Initially, the document data is extracted, specifically text and tabular data. Next, these data are stored in a way where the sequence is maintained, that way there will be more context for a certain text that may have a table before or after it. This set is chunked and converted BERT based vector embeddings and also BM25 based representations. Now the query is also converted to BERT based embeddings and BM25 based representations and the top-k chunks are retrieved for both. A union is taken between the retrieved chunks to avoid overlaps.<br><br>\n",

The query is passed into both structures and the scores are retrieved for each chunk. This gives us a table of chunk ID, BERT scores, BM25 scores and the final fusion score. Based on this fusion score, the top-k chunks are retrieved (5 chosen here). This, along with the original query is passed into an LLM for refined response."
