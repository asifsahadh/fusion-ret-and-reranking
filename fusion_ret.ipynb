    "_**What are your expectations for Fusion Retrieval with the provided manual?**_<br>\n",
    "Due to the hybrid nature, semantic matching and keyword matching, I expect this architecture to be quite robust compared to vanilla RAG. Both types of matching has its benefits when it comes to information retrieval and I would argue that this architecture would outperform the Reranking RAG architecture. However, semantic search may be considered superior to keyword matching so it would be better to have a higher weightage given to semantics. This theory requires testing of course."

    "The main approach taken here is where the initial chunks from the document are made into two copies, one is semantic based (using BERT), and the other is keyword based (BM25). After the top-K chunks are retrieved from both, a union operation is performed between the two. Next, this final set of chunks are again made into 2 copies of BERT based embeddings and BM25 based inverted indexes. The query is passed into both for scoring and the scores are retrieved for each chunk. This gives us a set of chunk IDs, BERT scores, BM25 scores and the final fusion score. This is the main idea and the process goes as follows:<br>\n",
    "1. The document data is extracted, specifically text and tabular data. \n",
    "2. Next, these data are stored in a way where the sequence is maintained, that way there will be more context for a certain text that may have a table before or after it. \n",
    "3. This set is chunked and converted to BERT based vector embeddings and also to BM25 based representations.\n",
    "4. Now the query is also converted to BERT based embeddings and BM25 based representations and the top-K chunks are retrieved for both. A union is taken between the retrieved chunks to avoid overlaps.\n",
    "5. Next, this final set of chunks are again made into 2 copies, one of BERT based embeddings and the other of BM25 based inverted indexes. The query is passed into both structures and the scores are retrieved for each chunk. This gives us a set of chunk IDs, BERT scores, BM25 scores and the final fusion score. \n",
    "6. Based on this fusion score, the top-L chunks are retrieved (L < K). \n",
    "7. These L chunks, which acts as context, along with the original query is passed into an LLM for a refined response.\n",
    "\n",
    "**It must be noted that K > L. In this implementation, they are set as 25 and 8 respectively.**"

    "_**Note**: Considering images is important in order to create a robust RAG system. Due to technical/financial constraints, images are omitted for this implementation. However, in the absence of such constraints, what I would have done is have the LLM read the image and prompt it to generate a description. This description will be added into the resulting array while also maintaining the sequence. **One obvious question in that case will be whether or not the LLM knows about the content in the image, provided that it is very domain specific and unfamiliar to the LLM**. One way I thought of on mitigating this issue is by providing some set of surrounding context of the image to the LLM along with the image itself for it to draw better conclusions. These contexts can be the nearest 2 or 3 elements (text, table or another image) surrounding the image in hand. Let this value be J. So, if J is 3, we feed 3 elements before the image and 3 elements after the image as context for the LLM to generate proper a description of the image in hand. This might not be the most efficient solution, but there can be scenarios where this will work._"

The manufacturer holds all ownership to material and intellectual property of this manual; any disclosure or copying, even partial, of this publication without prior written consent is forbidden. TEXT DATA: This manual is designed to provide the knowledge required for the use and maintenance of the  Gear head lathe (Art. T999/230V – T999/230V3A – T999/400V T999/400V3A) and to provide the operator assigned to the device with a sense of responsibility and knowledge of its possibilities and limitations. TEXT DATA: Operators must be properly trained and prepared, so make sure that this manual is read and consulted by the staff responsible for commissioning, operation and maintenance of the machine. This is to make all operations as safe and effective as possible for those who carry out these tasks. Therefore, it is imperative to strictly comply with the requirements in this manual, a necessary condition for safe and satisfactory operation of the Lathe. TEXT DATA: Before starting operation, installation and use of the machine, authorized staff must therefore: \\uf0b7 read this technical document carefully; \\uf0b7 know which protections and safety devices are available on the Lathe, their location and how they work. TEXT DATA: The buyer is responsible for ensuring that users are properly trained, that they are aware of all the information and instructions in this document and that they are aware of the potential risks of operating the Lathe. TEXT DATA: The manufacturer will not be held responsible for any damage to people and/or property caused by non-compliance with any instructions in this manual. TEXT DATA: Operators will be held fully responsible for any changes they have made to the machine; the manufacturer will not be held responsible for any damage to persons and/or property resulting from maintenance performed by unqualified personnel and in a manner that differs from the operating procedures shown below. TEXT DATA: Page 5 of 84 TEXT DATA: MACHINES AND ACCESSORIES TEXT DATA: The  Gear head lathe  has been designed and built with mechanical guards and safety devices designed to protect the operator/user from possible injury. It is strictly forbidden to modify or remove guards, safety devices and caution labels. If you do so temporarily (for example, for the purposes of cleaning or repair), make sure that no one can use the machine. TEXT DATA: Graphic representation of safety, operational and risk warnings TEXT DATA: The following boxes are designed to attract the attention of the reader / user for the  proper and  safe  use of the machine: TEXT DATA: Pay Attention TEXT DATA: This highlights behavioural rules to prevent damage to the machine and/or the occurrence of dangerous  sit u at ions. TEXT DATA: Residual Risks TEXT DATA: This highlights the presence of dangers that cause residual risks to which the operator must pay attentio n  i n  order to avoid injury or damage to property. TEXT DATA: Page 6 of 84 TEXT DATA: MACHINES AND TEXT DATA: ACCESSORIES TEXT DATA: 2 GENERAL SAFETY WARNINGS TEXT DATA: 2.1 General safety rules for machine equipment TEXT DATA: Follow the instructions contained herein, in addition to the general precautions to be observed while working. Even if the operator is already familiar with the use of manually operated lathes, it is necessary to: In particular: TEXT DATA: \\uf0b7 Acquire full knowledge of the machine. For safe operation, this manual must be read carefully in order to acquire the necessary knowledge of the machine and to understand: operation, safety devices and all necessary precautions. \\uf0b7 Wear appropriate clothing for the job. The operator must wear appropriate clothing to prevent accidents. \\uf0b7 Maintain the machine with care.TEXT DATA: 9 – Linear error compensation The linear error compensation function is used for the correction of errors in the transmission system of the lead screw. The correction factor is expressed as: TEXT DATA: \\uf028 \\uf029 \\uf028 \\uf029 m mm L TEXT DATA: \\' \\uf02d \\uf03d TEXT DATA: L L S / 1000 / TEXT DATA: where L  \\uf0e0 is the useful length of the Z axis in mm; L’ \\uf0e0 is the value displayed on the panel in mm; S  \\uf0e0 is the correction factor in mm/m. TEXT DATA: The correction factor can be positive if the displayed value is less than the actual length, negative if the value displayed is higher. The compensation range is ± 1.500 mm/m. TEXT DATA: Ex. If the useful length of the Y axes is 1000 mm and the panel at the end of travel of the carriage, reads 999.98 mm then S=(1000-999.98)/(1000/1000)=0.02 mm/m. So to enter the compensation value it is necessary to: TEXT DATA: M/ TEXT DATA: - Select the Y axis by pressing the button TEXT DATA: , pressing the button displays the correction factor S previously set. TEXT DATA: s 0. 0 5 0 Y TEXT DATA: - Enter the calculated value 0.02 by pressing in sequence the keys 0 . 0 2 TEXT DATA: s 0. 0 2 0 Y TEXT DATA: ENT TEXT DATA: - Press the button to confirm the data. TEXT DATA: The linear error compensation can be performed by either displaying the absolute coordinates, or displaying the relative coordinates. TEXT DATA: 10 – Disconnection of the power supply If the power supply is disconnected or it is necessary to turn off the machine during machining, the panel is able to automatically store the coordinates where the tool is located, the compensation factor currently set and the display mode.
